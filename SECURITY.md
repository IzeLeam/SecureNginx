Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in these templates or examples, please
follow this process to report it responsibly.

1. Do not post the vulnerability in public issue trackers.
2. Contact the maintainers at <SECURITY_EMAIL> with a clear summary, steps to reproduce, and a suggested mitigation.
3. Give maintainers time to respond and fix the issue before public disclosure.

If you need to report a critical issue and want encryption, include a PGP key in your message.

Note: These templates are educational; they do not provide full runtime security.
Always audit configs before applying to production systems.
